=====================================================

To run this scrip, please first make sure that the input data is available in the same directory.

The input dataset is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). After downloading the file, unzip it at the same level as the script run_analysis.R. The directory "UCI HAR Dataset" should be then at the same level as run_analysis.R.

The script depends on the library plyr, and assumes that it is installed. The script is tested with R version 3.2.1.
